# CSC120-FinalProject

For my final project, I will be developing a contact book app.

The app allows a user to:
- create a contact
- view a contact
- view all contacts in a particular order
- view the next and previous contact from the contact being currently being viewed
- update a contact
- delete a contact
- delete all contacts, if desired (clear the contact book)

**That's it. :-)**
